## Why this document?
It appears as if there if a bit of an encoding difference between the computers we're all using. The README is  Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text, and my computer is not too happy to read it. Instead of converting it to another format and confusing everyone, I figured I'd just added a second file with additional comments.
