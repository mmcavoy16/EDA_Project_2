# Which County In The US Is Worst For Surviving A Heart Attack? 

## How do we measure surviving a heart attack? 

- Compare estimated total deaths (see Death Measure Section) to counties that are similar in size OR other binning factor 

## Data Source
Readmissions and Deaths: 30-Day Readmission and Death Measures

**Reporting Cycle**: 7/01/2012 \- 6/30/2015 AND 7/01/2014 \- 6/30/2015 


## Death Measure 

30-Day "Death Measure" is an estimate of how many patients died within 30-days of being admitted to a given hospital.

- `denominator` : total number of patients with a given measure (ie. AMI)
- `score`: estimates of death within 30-days of a hospital admission 

## Variables that would be nice...

- AED(Automatic External Defibrillator) per capita OR by county
- CPR Training Rate by county 

Looks like several medical journals have obtained some of the variables above, but only with special permission from the American Heart Association.

## For The Worst Counties...
